# Kotlin Minefield

[Versão em Portugês](https://github.com/yagolasse/minefield-kotlin-gradle/blob/README.br.md)

This is as minefield written using Kotlin for JVM

I written this code when learning Kotlin from a Udemy course as part of the lesson.

It's a simple mine field game that runs on JVM based on awt graphics library.

On it I try to use most language resources that I can, keeping readbility and good programming practices always on first plan.

I'll eventually add code documentation.
